# FNB App Academy - Week 1 & 2 Basics

This repository contains my Week 1 and Week 2 work for the FNB App Academy.

### Week 1
- Learned the basics of **HTML** and how to set up a development environment.
- Created the structure of a web page from scratch.

### Week 2
- Learned the basics of **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) to make web pages look nicer by adding colors, fonts, and styles.
- Created a `style.css` file and linked it to `index.html`.
- Changed text colors and fonts.
- Styled lists with different bullet types.
- Added hover effects on links.
- Made a simple menu bar using div containers.

This project is my practice to combine HTML and CSS and build my first simple app.
